The Nexys A7 board includes two tri-color LEDs, sixteen slide switches, six push buttons, sixteen individual LEDs, and an eight-digit seven-segment display, as shown in Figure 9.1. The pushbuttons and slide switches are **connected to the FPGA via series resistors** to prevent damage from inadvertent short circuits (**a short circuit could occur if an FPGA pin assigned to a pushbutton or slide switch was inadvertently defined as an output**). The five pushbuttons arranged in a plus-sign configuration are **“momentary”** switches that normally generate a **low output when they are at rest**, and a **high output only when they are pressed**. The red pushbutton labeled **“CPU RESET,”** on the other hand, generates a **high output when at rest** and a **low output when pressed**. The CPU RESET button is intended to be used in EDK designs to **reset the processor**, but you can also use it as a **general purpose pushbutton**. Slide switches generate **constant** high or low inputs depending on their position. 


The sixteen individual high-efficiency LEDs are **anode-connected** to the FPGA via **330-ohm resistors**, so they will turn on when a logic **high voltage** is applied to their respective I/O pin. Additional LEDs that are not user-accessible indicate power-on, FPGA programming status, and USB and Ethernet port status.
